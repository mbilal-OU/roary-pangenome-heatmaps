 # Interactive Roary Gene Presence–Absence Heatmaps for Prokaryotic Pangenomes (R + heatmaply)

This repository provides a complete, reproducible workflow in **R** for generating
interactive, hover-enabled gene presence–absence heatmaps from **Roary** pangenome
outputs. Each genome is assigned a unique color, and genes are filtered based on
prevalence to create compact, interpretable visualizations ideal for microbial
comparative genomics, pangenome exploration, and scientific visualization.
